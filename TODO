Features:
        -try and test new libnf versions (> 1.16), check and reflect changes
        -optimization for ascending sort, there is possibility to vastly reduce
         number of read/transfered records. If the key value of first records
         is X and the key value of Nth record is also X, it is unnecessary to
         read further records. Similar optimization is possible for descending
         sort.

Bugfixes:
        -fix coverity bugs
        -use dynamic allocation for the slave transmit buffers. On some
         architectures, where stack size limit is low, current static memory
         allocation may cause big trouble.

Tests:
        -add tests for reading multiple input files at once to test
         multithreading
        -add tests for reading single/multiple very large files to test
         buffer switching
        -add tests for reading nonexistent/invalid/empty files in all modes.
         There is possibility of deadlock.

Documentation:
        -add info about path preprocessor

Others:
        -create and use more MPI tags
